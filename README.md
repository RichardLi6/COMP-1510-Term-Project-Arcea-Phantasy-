## Building The Game
```
This is a text based game is built using python 

It started by developing a nice Flowchart to layout the game flow

It uses multiple data structures such as 
  List 
    Ex: 
        - Character Health, Mana and Attack
     
  Dictionaries 
    Ex: 
        - Character Attributes 
        - Monster Attributes
    
  Tupples 
    Ex: 
        - Game Coordinates 
        - Prompt Choices
    
    
This game also demonstrates the use of commonly use syntax in Python 

  Functions
    
    Helper Functions
    Ex: 
        - Atomic Functions executing 1 part of the game
        - Functions that prints introduction
    
    Main Functions
    Ex: 
        - Collection of Helper Functions to execute whole game 
        - Main Game Function 
        - Fighting Function 
    
    Although Python is Intuitive for different types of Programming Paradigm this game
    focuses on following the Functional Paradigm Aspect of Python.
    

    Conditional Statements 
    Ex: 
        - Checking if the Character are at Special Coordinates
        - Check if character is still alive
        - Check if user met condition for winning the game 
    
    Loop:
    For Loop
        Ex:
            - Printing available skills a user has 
            - Printing the Map
        
    While Loop
        Ex: 
            - The Whole Game runs on the basis of this loop 
            - Loop for user decisions


  Exception Handling
    Exceptions:
        Ex: 
            - Prompting User for Corect Input  

Python Modules 
    
    Importing Built In Modules
        Ex: 
            - Organizing the Functions in Different Modules 
    
    Importing Non Bult In Modules
        Ex: 
            - Using Pip3 to Install Colorama to allow use of Colored Printed Text 
```

## Testing 
```
The game is tested through using the Disjointed Equivalence Partition 

Some of the unit testing will use patching to force an output from random number
generators and force an input for user prompts

Some functions will not be tested due to not being covered in Course, 
but rest assured the is working properly as game is also played by other players 
excluding the developers(Us). 

```

## Possible Future Updates
```
Add more Content for Boss 
Add Game Puzzles 
Add Side Quest
Add Multipler Feature
```
